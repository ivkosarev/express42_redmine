### This repository contains instructions for building Redmine from scratch, installing ruby 2.6.5, and Postgres 12. Everything is installed in 1 container, although this is an extremely incorrect use of Docker, but this was the original task.


***
To launch Redmine from this repository, just follow a few simple steps:

1. Clone the repository and go to its directory
2. Build an image (docker build)
3. Wait for the image to be built
4. Start the container with opening ports.
